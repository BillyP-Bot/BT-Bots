# Discord.js library:
https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/11.1.0/general/welcome

# Develop & Test:
- Clone Repo
- Fill .env file with proper credentials
    - BOT_TOKEN is token found on discord dev portal (will likely have to have a new bot created or issues will occur)
    - If you want to use Google API, will have to provide API key + 'Google custom Search Engine'
- Run 'npm i' to ensure that the local project has all packages installed
- Run 'npm run dev' to start project (will restart everytime a file is saved)
