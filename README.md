https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/11.1.0/general/welcome

# Develop & Test:
- Clone Repo
- Fill .env file with proper credentials
    - BOT_TOKEN = token found on discord dev portal (will likely have to have a new bot created or issues will occur)
    - Necessary to run functions with Google API calls:
        - GOOGLE_API_KEY
        - GOOGLE_CX_KEY
- Run 'npm i' to ensure that the local project has all packages installed
- Run 'npm run dev' to start project (will restart everytime a file is saved)
